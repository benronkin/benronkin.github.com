        <h1>Banner Engine: Privacy Policy</h1>
        <div class="col s12 m9">
          <p>
            Ben Ronkin ("the Developer") provides the Banner Engine Add-on for
            Google Workspace ("the Add-on") and the website at benronkin.com
            (referred to hereafter as "the Website") that provide the service.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page is used to inform Add-on users and Website visitors
            regarding the Developer's policies with the collection, use, and
            disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally
            Identifiable Information if anyone decided to use the Add-on or the
            Website.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you choose to use the Add-on or the Website, then you agree to
            the collection and use of information in relation with this policy.
            The Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personally
            Identifiable Information that the Developer collects are used for
            providing and improving the Service. The Developer will not use or
            share your information with anyone except as described in this
            Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
          <p>
            The Developer collects your email address when you purchase the
            license for the Add-on. The email address is used to send you an
            email receipt and to provide you with customer service. Your email
            address will not be used in any other way.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Website collects certain Non-Personally Identifiable
            Information. The Developer uses your IP address to diagnose problems
            with the Website, to administer the Website, and to gather
            demographic information. The Website analytic solution will also
            provide the Developer with summary, but not individual, reports that
            will tell the Developer how visitors access and use the Website.
          </p>
          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>
            The Website implements third-party analytics solution that may place
            cookies on your computer. Cookies placed on your computer by third
            parties by or through the Website, if any, are not the
            responsibility of the Developer and are not subject to this Privacy
            Policy. Please contact the third party placing these cookies to find
            out what information is collected and how it is used. You can
            usually edit your browser not to accept cookies, but the features of
            our Web Site may not function properly if you do accept cookies.
          </p>
          <h2>Google Drive Access</h2>
          <p>
            Information about managing, along with removing third-party access
            to Google Drive can be found on the Google help page
            <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3466521"
              >Third-party sites & apps with access to your account</a
            >.
          </p>
          <h2>Google API Services User Data Policy</h2>
          <p>
            The Developer's use and transfer to any other app of information
            received from Google APIs will adhere to

              href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes"
              >Google API Services User Data Policy</a
            >, including the Limited Use requirements.
          </p>
          <h2>Security</h2>
          <p>
            The Developer values your trust in providing him your Personal
            Information, thus he is striving to use commercially acceptable
            means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission
            over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure
            and reliable, and the Developer cannot guarantee its absolute
            security.
          </p>
          <h2>Links to Other Sites</h2>
          <p>
            The Add-on or the Website may contain links to other sites. If you
            click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
            that these external sites are not operated by the Developer.
            Therefore, the Developer strongly advises you to review the Privacy
            Policy of these websites. The Developer has no control over, and
            assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or
            practices of any third-party sites or services.
          </p>
          <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
          <p>
            The Add-on or the Website does not address anyone under the age of
            13. The Developer does not knowingly collect personal identifiable
            information from children under 13. In the case that the Developer
            discovers that a child under 13 has provided the Developer with
            personal information, the Developer immediately deletes this from
            his servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that
            your child has provided the Developer with personal information,
            please contact the Developer so that he will be able to do necessary
            actions.
          </p>
          <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>
            The Developer reserves the right to update this privacy policy with
            or without notice. Thus, the Developer advises you to review this
            page periodically for any changes. The Developer will notify you of
            any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These
            changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this
            page.
          </p>
