              The project required developing a Node.js app on Google Cloud
              Platform that processes campaign registrations from Google Sheets.
              The app reads the sheet via Google Sheets API, groups the
              registrations by campaign ID, and creates a CSV file for each
              campaign.
            </p>
            <p>
              The file then gets uploaded to Google Cloud Storage, where the app
              sets access permission on the file. Finally, the app emails a
              download link to the CSV file.

              This project involves parsing addresses in a Google Sheet along
              with their metadata. A Google Apps Script is launched via a custom
              menu. It creates a sidebar with a Google Map, converts the
              addresses into lat/long data points, centers the map according to
              the addresses, and displays the addresses as markers on the map.
            </p>
            <p>
              Address metadata is shown when the user hovers over the marker.
              The map can be viewed in full-screen mode.
