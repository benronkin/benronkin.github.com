                  Ben knows his stuff. He quickly grasps the concepts related to
                  our projects and asks the relevant right questions that
                  provide him with the clarification he needs to make sure the
                  job gets done right. Ben is quick to respond, quick to
                  deliver, easy to talk with, and provides to level support to
                  all his builds and code. Highly recommend!!!

                  Google Apps Script Developer Needed for Ongoing Integration
                  with Google Sites and Third-Party Apps
                </p>
                <p>
                  We hired Ben to help our complex Google Sites project achieve
                  beta status after a previous developer could no longer work.
                  Ben thoroughly assessed existing Apps Script code and
                  immediately began refactoring for scale and security. He
                  created very detailed workflow outlines that were meaningful
                  and comprehensive and made novel suggestions for problems
                  unique to our problem set. He asked plenty of questions and
                  was genuinely interested in understanding our reasoning for
                  development and platform choices. Highly competent but also
                  conservative in approach, which was much appreciated. Highly
                  capable of working with third-party APIs. We decided to pause
                  our contract because we are a nonprofit and needed to reassess
                  our needs after Ben helped us nearly achieve beta. We hope to
                  use Ben again in the future.

                  Ben did a great job helping us scope out a business process
                  and create the Apps script code to automate the processes.
                  Ben’s communication was excellent, and he kept the project on
                  track to meet a tight deadline. I would highly recommend Ben
                  for other similar projects. We will enlist his help for other
                  projects in the future.

                  Google Sheets Automation Specialist Needed For Growth Agency
                  Tool Creation
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ben was everything I needed for my Google Sheets automation
                  project and more. We needed a tool developed to automate some
                  of our internal processes for our agency and his ideas and
                  attention to detail were refreshing to see in a consultant. He
                  was always available for a strategy session or a quick chat to
                  overcome challenges, I would highly recommend him with any
                  automation, google sheets, or apps script project you have!
                </p>

                <p>
                  2nd review: Not only did Ben execute the google sheet tool
                  automations that my company needed, he suggested feature sets
                  that I would never have thought of. He is lightning quick,
                  razor sharp, and knew what I needed by asking great questions
                  and always double checking his work. He's a joy to work with
                  and i'm definitely going to continue using his expertise for
                  all things excel and/or sheets going forward. If you've got
                  something that you need to automate or a tool to build, he's
                  your guy!
