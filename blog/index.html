            A client of mine recently asked for my help in automating the data
            pulls they were doing. They wanted me to use the system's REST API
            to fetch new data and write it to a Google Sheet. The response
            payload of the API was pretty easy to navigate: essentially an array
            with a bunch of objects, where each object represented a user with
            certain keys for first and last names, phone, email -- that sort of
            thing. All I had to do was call the API periodically, get back new
            user objects, and them to a nested array so that I can append the
            data to Google Sheets.
          </p>
          <p>Easy enough, but there was one wrinkle...</p>

            We use Apps Script to increase our productivity when we use google
            sheets or google docs. But did you know that apps script can
            communicate with another apps script? We can exchange data between
            sheets that have their own scripts without having the user in the
            middle. One way to accomplish that is with the use of apps script
            web apps. A web app provides a url that users can access via a
            browser, but the url can also be used by another script.

            Imagine you have a Google Sheet with tabular sales data. The table
            contains sales volumes from four regions, represented in columns,
            and monthly sales volume represented in rows. Let's also say that
            you are developing a Google Apps Script that needs to do a few
            things, including summing up the sales in the East region.
          </p>
          <p>
            How would you go about coding that? Well, the easiest thing to do is
            to pull the values out of the East column one by one and...

            Google Apps Script is all about increasing work productivity through
            automation. But the road to automation involves a lot of mental and
            manual work. When we're developing scripts, we are often asked to
            make changes in Google Sheets or Google Drive items. Since we don't
            always get the scripts to make the right changes right away, we
            often have to undo the script changes manually, as we develop and
            enhance the script. And there's only so much we can do with the UNDO
            button in google sheets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let me show you how I use macros in Apps Script to cut down on the
            manual undoing, and make my work as a developer more efficient. I'll
            be covering four areas of changes...

            Let's say that you have a Google Apps Script that processes files
            that are generated by other people. Maybe it's your clients, or your
            team members, or your channel partners who provide the files –
            whatever the case may be, you build your script to operate on other
            people's files. In such a scenario I would assume that as a good
            developer, you would reach out to these people and agree with them
            on how they should populate and handle those files. Maybe you even
            give them a file template and ask them not to change its structure,
            but merely to duplicate it and fill out the information and then
            submit it to your script.
          </p>
          <p>
            Writing a script under the assumption that people would always abide
            by agreed-upon rules is asking for trouble. Even if they mean well,
            people are still human, and humans can and will – for whatever
            reason – break the rules. And when they break the rules, they can
            break down your script. And tracking down the cause of the script
            error because of a malformed input file can be difficult and time
            consuming.

            A Google Sheet sidebar is an extra pane that you can open alongside
            your sheets. It lets you manipulate the contents of the sheets from
            a centralized place.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll review the sidebar in the context of mail merge, a solution
            that I covered in previous posts. Mail merge has an admin sheet
            where the user can select an email template, preview the campaign,
            and launch the campaign. In this post, I'll migrate this
            functionality to a sidebar.

            Displaying HTML pages inside a spreadsheet is quite common and
            useful when you do automation stuff. The HTML resides inside a popup
            that we can easily show when the user clicks on a button or selects
            from a custom menu. The HTML inside a popup supports CSS and
            Javascript, so you can offer really beautiful and useful HTML
            experiences inside a spreadsheet.

            Sending SMS messages directly from a Google Sheet is both easy and
            useful. Let's assume that we have a Google Sheet that gets populated
            with phone numbers of people that we'd like to contact via an SMS
            message. In this post we will see how to implement a solution using
            Google Apps Script.

            we looked at a rudimentary mail merge for Gmail using Apps Script.
            The script used a global object that housed the default subject line
            and body for our emails. We incorporated placeholders into the text
            that the script replaced with recipients' data. There are, however,
            a couple of issues with this approach. So, instead, we are going to
            store the email templates in a Google Docs. We will populate a
            dropdown with the names of the files, so that we can choose the
            email template with a single mouse click.

            In this post I offer a short and sweet Google Apps Script for
            creating mail merge in Gmail. The script is very basic, merely meant
            to introduce the topic. In future posts I'll add more features and
            capabilities.

            Mail merge is essentially the ability to send multiple emails in one
            operation, yet personalize the email to each recipient. It saves you
            the time and energy to compose multiple emails to multiple
            recipients that say the same thing. With mail merge, you take an
            email template, and a list of recipients. You then replace
            placeholders in the template with the data of each recipients. Like
            I said, pretty simple stuff.

            Having a system that automatically responds to incoming email
            messages can be a great time saver. In this post you will learn how
            to create such a system for Gmail, using Google Apps Script.

            There's often a need to extract statistics about YouTube channels;
            specifically, data about the channels themselves, as well as their
            videos and playlists. While it's possible to extract this data
            manually by visiting various YouTube pages and doing a lot of
            copying and pasting, this approach does not scale well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, Google offers an API (application programming interface) to
            extract this very information. The Google Data API offers a
            consistent way for developers to pull data about YouTube channels,
            videos, and playlists. Developers can write programs or scripts that
            call the different endpoints (URLs) of the API to extract the
            information.

            This post details my experience in deploying Stripe payments using
            Google Apps Script (GAS) in three different projects. The Stripe
            platform is easy to use, and when it's combined with GAS, launching
            a payment system is straightforward.

            As a Google Workspace developer, I live in Google Drive all day
            long. It's often the case that I need to duplicate a complex
            structure of Drive folders and files.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unfortunately, there is no easy way in Google Drive right now to
            duplicate folders quickly like you can do with a Google Sheet, for
            example. You have to copy stuff manually one by one, which is very
            annoying.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this blog post I'll walk you though the process of creating a
            Google Apps Script web app that will automate the folder duplication
            process.

            I often write code that operates on Google Sheets, which means that
            I have to deal with nested arrays a lot. One of the things I have to
            do is to find rows in one array that don't have corresponding rows
            in another nested array.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, I may have a Google Sheet with some user information,
            and another sheet with file information. Files are created for
            unique combinations of user departments and user roles. As more
            users are added to the users sheet, I need to find department-role
            combinations that don't already have a corresponding file.

            I have a Google Sheet with a column for company names. To ensure
            data quality, I prefer to select the company name in each row from a
            dropdown list so that the company is always spelled the same way. I
            could use the standard data validation in Google Sheet, but my list
            of companies contains over 35,000 names, and adding all of them into
            a data validation rule slows down Google Sheets considerably.

            I use Google Sheets to track my stock investments. Sure, there are
            plenty of online tools that can do this for you, but I use Sheets
            because I like to develop my own metrics and see if they help me
            make smarter buy/sell decisions in the long run.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having custom metrics means developing custom functions in Google
            Apps Script and then applying them inside Google Sheet cells.

            Whenever I need to write a cloud function for a Google Cloud
            Platform (GCP) project, I prefer to develop and test my code locally
            and deploy it as a cloud function only when it's done. It's often
            the case that I need to use environment variables to store important
            and sensitive information. For instance, if my code needs to access
            a Google Sheet via the Google Sheet API, then I prefer to store the
            sheet ID in an environment variable, instead of hard-coding it in
            the code.

            Cloud functions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are a great way to
            ship production code quickly and efficiently. I often use them to
            take advantage of the services that GCP offers, such as Google
            Sheets API.
          </p>
          <p>
            This post details the process of using Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
            to deploy a cloud function that uses the Sheets API. I use the code
            included in this article as a template for all my GCP projects. This
            speeds up the process of creating new projects.
