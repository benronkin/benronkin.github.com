            we looked at a rudimentary mail merge for Gmail using Apps Script.
            The script used a global object that housed the default subject line
            and body for our emails. We incorporated placeholders into the text
            that the script replaced with recipients' data. There are, however,
            a couple of issues with this approach. So, instead, we are going to
            store the email templates in a Google Docs. We will populate a
            dropdown with the names of the files, so that we can choose the
            email template with a single mouse click.

            In this post I offer a short and sweet Google Apps Script for
            creating mail merge in Gmail. The script is very basic, merely meant
            to introduce the topic. In future posts I'll add more features and
            capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mail merge is essentially the ability to send multiple emails in one
            operation, yet personalize the email to each recipient. It saves you
            the time and energy to compose multiple emails to multiple
            recipients that say the same thing. With mail merge, you take an
            email template, and a list of recipients. You then replace
            placeholders in the template with the data of each recipients. Like
            I said, pretty simple stuff.

            Having a system that automatically responds to incoming email
            messages can be a great time saver. In this post you will learn how
            to create such a system for Gmail, using Google Apps Script.

            There's often a need to extract statistics about YouTube channels;
            specifically, data about the channels themselves, as well as their
            videos and playlists. While it's possible to extract this data
            manually by visiting various YouTube pages and doing a lot of
            copying and pasting, this approach does not scale well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, Google offers an API (application programming interface) to
            extract this very information. The Google Data API offers a
            consistent way for developers to pull data about YouTube channels,
            videos, and playlists. Developers can write programs or scripts that
            call the different endpoints (URLs) of the API to extract the
            information.

            Google Apps Script (GAS) in three different projects. The Stripe
            platform is easy to use, and when it's combined with GAS, launching
            a payment system is straightforward.

            As a Google Workspace developer, I live in Google Drive all day
            long. It's often the case that I need to duplicate a complex
            structure of Drive folders and files.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unfortunately, there is no easy way in Google Drive right now to
            duplicate folders quickly like you can do with a Google Sheet, for
            example. You have to copy stuff manually one by one, which is very
            annoying.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this blog post I'll walk you though the process of creating a
            Google Apps Script web app that will automate the folder duplication
            process.

            I often write code that operates on Google Sheets, which means that
            I have to deal with nested arrays a lot. One of the things I have to
            do is to find rows in one array that don't have corresponding rows
            in another nested array.
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, I may have a Google Sheet with some user information,
            and another sheet with file information. Files are created for
            unique combinations of user departments and user roles. As more
            users are added to the users sheet, I need to find department-role
            combinations that don't already have a corresponding file.

            I have a Google Sheet with a column for company names. To ensure
            data quality, I prefer to select the company name in each row from a
            dropdown list so that the company is always spelled the same way. I
            could use the standard data validation in Google Sheet, but my list
            of companies contains over 35,000 names, and adding all of them into
            a data validation rule slows down Google Sheets considerably.

            because I like to develop my own metrics and see if they help me
            make smarter buy/sell decisions in the long run.

            Having custom metrics means developing custom functions in Google

            Whenever I need to write a cloud function for a Google Cloud
            Platform (GCP) project, I prefer to develop and test my code locally
            and deploy it as a cloud function only when it's done. It's often
            the case that I need to use environment variables to store important
            and sensitive information. For instance, if my code needs to access
            a Google Sheet via the Google Sheet API, then I prefer to store the
            sheet ID in an environment variable, instead of hard-coding it in
            the code.

            Cloud functions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are a great way to
            ship production code quickly and efficiently. I often use them to
            take advantage of the services that GCP offers, such as Google
            Sheets API.
          </p>
          <p>
            This post details the process of using Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
            to deploy a cloud function that uses the Sheets API. I use the code
            included in this article as a template for all my GCP projects. This
            speeds up the process of creating new projects.
