            Are you familiar with the Add-to-Calendar widget that shows up in
            confirmation emails and web pages after a user registers to an event
            or a meeting? the widget enables the user to quickly add the event
            to their favorite calendar.

            If you'd like to have the ability to quickly create such widgets for

            sharing the code for an online form that you can use to generate
            these widgets.

            Adding a timer to a form is a great way to limit the time alloted to
            fill out and submit the form. If you run online quizzes, for
            instance, a timer mapped to a form can go a long way. Google Form
            doesn't allow us to embed a timer inside a form, but luckily we can
            use Google Apps Script to build a web app that has a timer and
            embeds a form.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this tutorial we will build such a web app. In addition to the
            timer, the web app will allow the form user to pause the timer once,
            and then resume filling out the form (in case they need a bathroom
            break, for example).
          </p>
          <p>
            But wait, there's more: our web app will also collect data on how
            users interact with the form: when they access it, pause it, resume
            it, run out of time, or submit the form.

            we saw how to use the OpenAI Dall-E API to convert text prompts to
            images programmatically, using Google Apps Script. In this post we
            will see how to use the API to manipulate existing images. We will
            edit areas of an image, as well as create whole variations of an
            image. Let's get going with Apps Script.

            Since AI is all the rage now, I wanted to explore how to use the
            OpenAI Dall-E service to create images automatically. How about
            creating images for my blog posts? I could use the posts' summaries
            as prompts for ChatGPT, asking the service to produce a list of
            physical objects that could represent the contents of the summaries.
            Then I'll feed those objects to Dall-E, asking it to create an image
            that contains those objects. Once Dall-E provides the image URLs,
            I'll have the automation download the files to my Google Drive.
            Let's see how to do this with Google Apps Script.

            I have a
            <a href="../reviews.html">reviews page</a> on my site where I list
            client testimonials. I have a simple review submission form that
            clients populate with their review text, name, and email. When the
            form is submitted, I receive its information in a simple email
            message. I then copy/paste the information to my reviews page.
            Everything works fine except for one issue: often, clients don't
            know what to say in the review or how to structure their message.
            They want to help me but they are not sure what the review should
            say.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, ChatGPT can assist clients in drafting their personalized
            reviews. In this post, we'll see how to build a Google Apps
            Script-based system that accepts talking points from clients,
            converts them to a ChatGPT prompt, get a review draft from the AI,
            and enables the clients to edit and post their reviews. We'll get
            their review in an email message.

            ChatGPT! It's on everyone's mind these days. Luckily, the OpenAI
            company offers a public API for ChatGPT, which means that we can
            connect to ChatGPT from Google Apps Script. Hooray!
          </p>
          <p>
            To understand how to use the API, let's imagine that we work in a
            real-estate agency, where our agents tour new properties, take notes
            about each property, and compose property overviews with the notes
            from their tours to be posted on the MLS. We can use the ChatGPT API
            to feed the agent notes and receive a compelling overview
            automatically.

            we saw how to aggregate email messages on a web page, so that we
            could read our newsletters on a single page, as opposed to fetching
            them from our overflowing inbox. One problem with injecting external
            HTML into your page is that the HTML can come with its own styling
            rules, and those rules can conflict with and overwrite other rules,
            whether in other HTML snippets or in your own page. This is
            happening because as the web browser renders the injected HTML, it
            processes any styling it encounters, and applies it – if relevant –
            to other snippets or to the containing page.

            Airtable is a great solution for storing data of all kinds, and many
            people are using it for different use cases. Let's learn how to push
            Airtable data to a Google Doc. We'll use a simple Airtable base with
            a single Products table that has three columns: Name, SKU, and
            Quantity. We want to push to Google Doc all of the out-of-stock
            products whose quantity equals zero.

            Let's build a system that lets the user select a label type. The
            script will create a template that corresponds with the user's
            selection. The user will then paste a set of placeholders inside the
            template, and our Apps Script will take some fake recipients' data
            and mail-merge it into the labels. Sounds good? Lovely!

            YouTube has a terrific user interface that provides channel managers
            and owners like you and me with valuable statistics about the
            performance of our channels and their videos. But YouTube also has
            rich APIs that enable us to pull the data out of the system to
            anywhere we to consume it. So lets build a Google Apps Script webapp
            that will respond to GET requests and send over subscriber and
            comment information.

            Let's say that you have a bunch of functions that do different
            things, but at the end, they all call the same function. Let's call
            that function "wrapUp." Each time wrapUp gets called, you want it to
            log the name of its caller. How can you do that?
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, the easiest thing would be to have each of the calling
            functions pass strings containing their names to wrapUp and have the
            latter log those parameters. But what if you don't or can't have the
            functions pass such strings?

            I don't know about you, but I have a love-hate relationship with
            newsletter emails. On one hand, newsletters have terrific content: I
            get new, in-depth information directly from the source. Newsletters
            keep me informed about the subjects I care about the most.
          </p>
          <p>
            But I really, really dislike emails. For starters, I'm a zero-inbox
            kind of guy: I don't like emails sitting in my inbox. As soon as an
            email comes in, I'd like to process it and get rid of it right there
            and then. But I'm also very busy which means that I usually don't
            have the time to read newsletter emails when they decide to pop in.

            to the management team at our company regarding their recent
            decision to discontinue the work-from-home policy and have everyone
            back at the office? Well, I have bad news and good news: The bad
            news is that management would not relent: all employees must return
            to the office full-time. But the good news is that management has
            decided to institute a new performance-based bonus program!
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, our payroll manager needs our help in automating parts of the

            listed with their names, email addresses, and other data. The
            manager is asking us to create a custom menu in the spreadsheet that
            will list all the employees alphabetically. She wants to be able to
            choose an employee in the menu and have our automation kick-off a
            bonus payment for that employee.

            All good things, as the saying goes, come to an end. After letting
            us work fully remote for past couple of years, management at our
            fledging startup has recently announced that it expected everyone
            back at the office five days a week. Goodbye work flexibility, and
            hello (again) insane commutes.

            You, dear reader, and I – AKA The OGs on the company's Slack – are
            of course not going to put up with that. After all, our fellow
            employees are looking to us to take a stand, and, darn it, we will.
            We are going to write a petition in a Google Doc that we will share
            with management, letting them know exactly how we feel about their
            inane decision. But it's not just you and I to do the writing: we'll
            get the troops to contribute their thoughts as well. We'll collect
            comments from colleagues and embed them in the document using a
            simple Google Form with two questions: "Enter your comment" and

            Let's pretend that you run a home-improvement store, with lots of
            products on the shelves. Every day or so, you pick a bunch of
            products and note them in a Google Sheet.
          </p>
          <p>
            You'd like to have your loyal employee run an inventory check and
            note the quantity of each product. There's only one wrinkle: as
            loyal as the employee is, you don't want to give them access to the
            Google Sheet itself; who knows what they'd do with it?

            I interact with a lot of people using Gmail messages and Google
            Calendar events. I'd like to collect the contact info of these
            individuals in Google Contacts as my de-facto CRM. Adding these
            records manually takes too much time: I'd like this done
            programmatically. Thing is, I don't want to mine
            <b>every</b> email and invite: some of these are transactional
            emails or one-off meetings. Instead, I'd like to have the contact
            info aggregated into a Google Sheet where I can visually inspect the
            rows, mark which ones to save and which ones to ignore.

            Custom menus in Google Sheets are a terrific way to let users kick
            off automation functions on their own terms. When we empower users
            to decide when and what automation to run, we improve the
            effectiveness of our automation code.
          </p>
          <p>
            But custom menus have two issues when they're part of scripts that
            require access to sensitive or restricted scopes...

            A client of mine recently asked for my help in automating the data
            pulls they were doing. They wanted me to use the system's REST API
            to fetch new data and write it to a Google Sheet. The response
            payload of the API was pretty easy to navigate: essentially an array
            with a bunch of objects, where each object represented a user with
            certain keys for first and last names, phone, email -- that sort of
            thing. All I had to do was call the API periodically, get back new
            user objects, and them to a nested array so that I can append the
            data to Google Sheets.
          </p>
          <p>Easy enough, but there was one wrinkle...</p>

            We use Apps Script to increase our productivity when we use google
            sheets or google docs. But did you know that apps script can
            communicate with another apps script? We can exchange data between
            sheets that have their own scripts without having the user in the
            middle. One way to accomplish that is with the use of apps script
            web apps. A web app provides a url that users can access via a
            browser, but the url can also be used by another script.

            Imagine you have a Google Sheet with tabular sales data. The table
            contains sales volumes from four regions, represented in columns,
            and monthly sales volume represented in rows. Let's also say that
            you are developing a Google Apps Script that needs to do a few
            things, including summing up the sales in the East region.
          </p>
          <p>
            How would you go about coding that? Well, the easiest thing to do is
            to pull the values out of the East column one by one and...

            Google Apps Script is all about increasing work productivity through
            automation. But the road to automation involves a lot of mental and
            manual work. When we're developing scripts, we are often asked to
            make changes in Google Sheets or Google Drive items. Since we don't
            always get the scripts to make the right changes right away, we
            often have to undo the script changes manually, as we develop and
            enhance the script. And there's only so much we can do with the UNDO
            button in google sheets.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let me show you how I use macros in Apps Script to cut down on the
            manual undoing, and make my work as a developer more efficient. I'll
            be covering four areas of changes...

            Let's say that you have a Google Apps Script that processes files
            that are generated by other people. Maybe it's your clients, or your
            team members, or your channel partners who provide the files –
            whatever the case may be, you build your script to operate on other
            people's files. In such a scenario I would assume that as a good
            developer, you would reach out to these people and agree with them
            on how they should populate and handle those files. Maybe you even
            give them a file template and ask them not to change its structure,
            but merely to duplicate it and fill out the information and then
            submit it to your script.
          </p>
          <p>
            Writing a script under the assumption that people would always abide
            by agreed-upon rules is asking for trouble. Even if they mean well,
            people are still human, and humans can and will – for whatever
            reason – break the rules. And when they break the rules, they can
            break down your script. And tracking down the cause of the script
            error because of a malformed input file can be difficult and time
            consuming.

            A Google Sheet sidebar is an extra pane that you can open alongside
            your sheets. It lets you manipulate the contents of the sheets from
            a centralized place.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll review the sidebar in the context of mail merge, a solution
            that I covered in previous posts. Mail merge has an admin sheet
            where the user can select an email template, preview the campaign,
            and launch the campaign. In this post, I'll migrate this
            functionality to a sidebar.

            Displaying HTML pages inside a spreadsheet is quite common and
            useful when you do automation stuff. The HTML resides inside a popup
            that we can easily show when the user clicks on a button or selects
            from a custom menu. The HTML inside a popup supports CSS and
            Javascript, so you can offer really beautiful and useful HTML
            experiences inside a spreadsheet.

            Sending SMS messages directly from a Google Sheet is both easy and
            useful. Let's assume that we have a Google Sheet that gets populated
            with phone numbers of people that we'd like to contact via an SMS
            message. In this post we will see how to implement a solution using
            Google Apps Script.

            we looked at a rudimentary mail merge for Gmail using Apps Script.
            The script used a global object that housed the default subject line
            and body for our emails. We incorporated placeholders into the text
            that the script replaced with recipients' data. There are, however,
            a couple of issues with this approach. So, instead, we are going to
            store the email templates in a Google Docs. We will populate a
            dropdown with the names of the files, so that we can choose the
            email template with a single mouse click.

            In this post I offer a short and sweet Google Apps Script for
            creating mail merge in Gmail. The script is very basic, merely meant
            to introduce the topic. In future posts I'll add more features and
            capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mail merge is essentially the ability to send multiple emails in one
            operation, yet personalize the email to each recipient. It saves you
            the time and energy to compose multiple emails to multiple
            recipients that say the same thing. With mail merge, you take an
            email template, and a list of recipients. You then replace
            placeholders in the template with the data of each recipients. Like
            I said, pretty simple stuff.

            Having a system that automatically responds to incoming email

            to create such a system for Gmail, using Google Apps Script.

            There's often a need to extract statistics about YouTube channels;
            specifically, data about the channels themselves, as well as their
            videos and playlists. While it's possible to extract this data
            manually by visiting various YouTube pages and doing a lot of
            copying and pasting, this approach does not scale well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, Google offers an API (application programming interface) to
            extract this very information. The Google Data API offers a
            consistent way for developers to pull data about YouTube channels,
            videos, and playlists. Developers can write programs or scripts that
            call the different endpoints (URLs) of the API to extract the
            information.

            As a Google Workspace developer, I live in Google Drive all day
            long. It's often the case that I need to duplicate a complex
            structure of Drive folders and files.
          </p>

          <p>
            Unfortunately, there is no easy way in Google Drive right now to
            duplicate folders quickly like you can do with a Google Sheet, for
            example. You have to copy stuff manually one by one, which is very
            annoying.

            I often write code that operates on Google Sheets, which means that
            I have to deal with nested arrays a lot. One of the things I have to
            do is to find rows in one array that don't have corresponding rows
            in another nested array.

            For instance, I may have a Google Sheet with some user information,
            and another sheet with file information. Files are created for
            unique combinations of user departments and user roles. As more
            users are added to the users sheet, I need to find department-role
            combinations that don't already have a corresponding file.

            of companies contains over 35,000 names, and adding all of them into
            a data validation rule slows down Google Sheets considerably.

            I use Google Sheets to track my stock investments. Sure, there are
            plenty of online tools that can do this for you, but I use Sheets
            because I like to develop my own metrics and see if they help me
            make smarter buy/sell decisions in the long run.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having custom metrics means developing custom functions in Google
            Apps Script and then applying them inside Google Sheet cells.

            Whenever I need to write a cloud function for a Google Cloud
            Platform (GCP) project, I prefer to develop and test my code locally
            and deploy it as a cloud function only when it's done. It's often
            the case that I need to use environment variables to store important
            and sensitive information. For instance, if my code needs to access
            a Google Sheet via the Google Sheet API, then I prefer to store the
            sheet ID in an environment variable, instead of hard-coding it in
            the code.

            Cloud functions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) are a great way to
            ship production code quickly and efficiently. I often use them to
            take advantage of the services that GCP offers, such as Google
            Sheets API.

            This post details the process of using Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
            to deploy a cloud function that uses the Sheets API. I use the code
            included in this article as a template for all my GCP projects. This
            speeds up the process of creating new projects.
