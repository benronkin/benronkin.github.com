            <title>Get more customer reviews with ChatGPT and Apps Script</title>
            <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have a
            <a href="https://benronkin.com/reviews.html">reviews page</a> on my site where I list
            client testimonials. I have a simple review submission form that
            clients populate with their review text, name, and email. When the
            form is submitted, I receive its information in a simple email
            message. I then copy/paste the information to my reviews page.
            Everything works fine except for one issue: often, clients don't
            know what to say in the review or how to structure their message.
            They want to help me but they are not sure what the review should
            say.
          </p>
          <p>
            Luckily, ChatGPT can assist clients in drafting their personalized
            reviews. In this post, we'll see how to build a Google Apps
            Script-based system that accepts talking points from clients,
            converts them to a ChatGPT prompt, get a review draft from the AI,
            and enables the clients to edit and post their reviews. We'll get
            their review in an email message.

            <title>Build a Telegram chat bot for ChatGPT with Google Apps Script</title>

                >previous post</a
              >, we saw how to use Google Apps Script to read real-estate
              property highlights from a Google Sheet, feed them to ChatGPT, and
              store the property summaries that ChatGPT wrote for us in Google
              Docs. Subsequently, I received a request on my

            <title>Use ChatGPT API with Google Apps Script</title>
            <description>ChatGPT! It's on everyone's mind these days. Luckily, the OpenAI
              company offers a public API for ChatGPT, which means that we can
              connect to ChatGPT from Google Apps Script. Hooray!
              To understand how to use the API, let's imagine that we work in a
              real-estate agency, where our agents tour new properties, take
              notes about each property, and compose property overviews with the
              notes from their tours to be posted on the MLS. We can use the
              ChatGPT API to feed the agent notes and receive a compelling
              overview automatically.</description>

            &lt;a href="https://benronkin.com/blog/aggregate-newsletters-with-apps-script.html"
              &gt;previous post&lt;/a
            &gt;
            we saw how to aggregate email messages on a web page, so that we
            could read our newsletters on a single page, as opposed to fetching
            them from our overflowing inbox. One problem with injecting external
            HTML into your page is that the HTML can come with its own styling
            rules, and those rules can conflict with and overwrite other rules,
            whether in other HTML snippets or in your own page. This is
            happening because as the web browser renders the injected HTML, it
            processes any styling it encounters, and applies it – if relevant –
            to other snippets or to the containing page.</description>

            <title>Push Airtable data to Google Docs</title>
            <description>Airtable is a great solution for storing data of all kinds, and
              many people are using it for different use cases. Let's learn how
              to push Airtable data to a Google Doc. We'll use a simple Airtable
              base with a single Products table that has three columns: Name,
              SKU, and Quantity. We want to push to Google Doc all of the
              out-of-stock products whose quantity equals zero.</description>

            <title>Print labels with mail-merge using Apps Script</title>
            <description>Are people still printing labels these days? I guess they are. Well,
            we can help those poor souls with some good-old Apps Script magic.
            Let's build a system that lets the user select a label type. The
            script will create a template that corresponds with the user's
            selection. The user will then paste a set of placeholders inside the
            template, and our Apps Script will take some fake recipients' data
            and mail-merge it into the labels. Sounds good? Lovely!</description>

            <title>Fetch YouTube subscribers and comments with Apps Script</title>
            <description>YouTube has a terrific user interface that provides channel
              managers and owners like you and me with valuable statistics about
              the performance of our channels and their videos. But YouTube also
              has rich APIs that enable us to pull the data out of the system to
              anywhere we to consume it. So lets build a Google Apps Script
              webapp that will respond to GET requests and send over subscriber
              and comment information.</description>

            <title>Aggregate newsletter emails with a Google Apps Script webapp</title>
            <description>I don't know about you, but I have a love-hate relationship with newsletter emails. On one hand, newsletters have terrific content: I get new, in-depth information directly from the source. Newsletters keep me informed about the subjects I care about the most. But I really, really dislike emails. For starters, I'm a zero-inbox kind of guy: I don't like emails sitting in my inbox. As soon as an email comes in, I'd like to process it and get rid of it right there and then. But I'm also very busy which means that I usually don't have the time to read newsletter emails when they decide to pop in.</description>

            <description>All good things, as the saying goes, come to an end. After letting us work fully remote for past couple of years, management at our fledging startup has recently announced that it expected everyone back at the office five days a week. Goodbye work flexibility, and hello (again) insane commutes. You, dear reader, and I – AKA The OGs on the company's Slack – are of course not going to put up with that. After all, our fellow employees are looking to us to take a stand, and, darn it, we will. We are going to write a petition in a Google Doc that we will share with management, letting them know exactly how we feel about their inane decision. But it's not just you and I to do the writing: we'll get the troops to contribute their thoughts as well. We'll collect comments from colleagues and embed them in the document using a simple Google Form with two questions: "Enter your comment" and "Enter your name."</description>

            <description>Let's pretend that you run a home-improvement store, with lots of products on the shelves. Every day or so, you pick a bunch of products and note them in a Google Sheet. You'd like to have your loyal employee run an inventory check and note the quantity of each product. There's only one wrinkle: as loyal as the employee is, you don't want to give them access to the Google Sheet itself; who knows what they'd do with it? How can we automate our way around this pickle?</description>

I'd like to collect the contact info of these individuals in Google Contacts as my de-facto CRM. Adding these records manually takes too much time: I'd like this done programmatically. Thing is, I don't want to mine every email and invite: some of these are transactional emails or one-off meetings. Instead, I'd like to have the contact info aggregated into a Google Sheet where I can visually inspect the rows, mark which ones to save and which ones to ignore.</description>

            <description>A client of mine recently asked for my help in automating the data pulls they were doing. They wanted me to use the system's REST API to fetch new data and write it to a Google Sheet. The response payload of the API was pretty easy to navigate: essentially an array with a bunch of objects, where each object represented a user with certain keys for first and last names, phone, email -- that sort of thing. All I had to do was call the API periodically, get back new user objects, and them to a nested array so that I can append the data to Google Sheets. Easy enough, but there was one wrinkle...</description>

            <description>We use Apps Script to increase our productivity when we use google sheets or google docs. But did you know that apps script can communicate with another apps script? We can exchange data between sheets that have their own scripts without having the user in the middle. One way to accomplish that is with the use of apps script web apps. A web app provides a url that users can access via a browser, but the url can also be used by another script.</description>

            <description>Google Apps Script is all about increasing work productivity through automation. But the road to automation involves a lot of mental and manual work. When we're developing scripts, we are often asked to make changes in Google Sheets or Google Drive items. Since we don't always get the scripts to make the right changes right away, we often have to undo the script changes manually, as we develop and enhance the script. And there's only so much we can do with the UNDO button in google sheets.</description>

            <description>Let's say that you have a Google Apps Script that processes files that are generated by other people. Maybe it's your clients, or your team members, or your channel partners who provide the files – whatever the case may be, you build your script to operate on other people's files. In such a scenario I would assume that as a good developer, you would reach out to these people and agree with them on how they should populate and handle those files. Maybe you even give them a file template and ask them not to change its structure, but merely to duplicate it and fill out the information and then submit it to your script.</description>

            <description>A Google Sheet sidebar is an extra pane that you can open alongside your sheets. It lets you manipulate the contents of the sheets from a centralized place. I'll review the sidebar in the context of mail merge, a solution that I covered in previous posts.
