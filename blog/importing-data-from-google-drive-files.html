              This is the first post in the
              <a href="automate-google-sheets-intro.html"

              series. Here I'm going to list some considerations that you as a
              business manager should keep in mind when populating a Google
              Sheet with data from external files.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a business manager you may need to work with external data.
              This often entails logging into a third-party system and
              downloading a file. You then open the file, copy the required
              data, and paste it into the Google Sheet.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've seen many workflows that incorporate this type of work, such
              as appending data to a log, consolidating columns from different
              sources into one spreadsheet, converting data formats, and finding
              and replacing data in different cells.
            </p>
            <p>
              As you may have experienced, this process isn't terribly
              productive. You're required to follow a strict and frankly boring
              procedure that is error-prone: you may copy the wrong data or
              paste it in the wrong place.
            </p>
            <p>
              The good news is that this type of work is ideal for automation.
              Google Apps Script – the scripting solution for Google Workspace –
              is very strong when it comes to pulling data out of Google Drive
              files.
            </p>

            <p>
              Here are some considerations to keep in mind as you consider
              automating data ingestion into a Google Sheet:
            </p>

            <h2 id="structure">How to structure the automation system</h2>

            <p>
              My recommendation is that you create a centralized Google Drive
              folder to house all of your automation projects. This will make it
              easy to find and maintain the automation scripts over time. Let's
              call this top folder <strong>Automations</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inside <strong>Automations</strong>, we will have a set of
              sub-folders, each for a specific automation project. It's
              important to keep different scripts separate for ease of
              maintenance. Let's call once such folder
              <strong>Project A</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Inside <strong>Project A</strong>, I typically like to have three
              sub-folders:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>- Admin</li>
              <li>- Inputs</li>
              <li>- Output</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Inside the <strong>Admin</strong> folder, I keep the script. It's
              important to decide whether the script should be bound to a Google
              Spreadsheet or be a standalone script file. I typically prefer to
              use a Spreadsheet-bound script, unless the script does several
              things (like serving a web app or writing to several
              spreadsheets).
            </p>

            <p>
              Inside the <strong>Admin</strong> folder I might create a
              subfolder to house templates. The script might need to duplicate a
              template and populate it as part of the data ingestion process, so
              it's good to keep the templates organized.
            </p>

            <p>
              The <strong>Inputs</strong> folder is used as the staging area.
              That's the folder you will use to drag-and-drop your external
              files into. I usually like to create an
              <strong>Archive</strong> sub-folder inside
              <strong>Inputs</strong> where the script automatically moves the
              input file at the end of the process. This helps keeping the
              staging area clear and avoid issues such as data duplication as a
              result of processing the same file several times.
            </p>

            <p>
              Finally, the <strong>Output</strong> sub-folder houses the output
              of the automation process. The script will either create a new
              Google Sheet there that you later move to someplace else or update
              an existing Google Sheet with new data.
            </p>

            <h2 id="source-to-target">How to map source and target files</h2>

            <p>
              The way the automation script pulls source data into a target
              Google Sheet depends largely on the schemas (i.e, the column names
              and order) of the two files. If the two files have identical
              column headers then a mapping isn't required: the automation can
              pull the source data rows and paste them into the target sheet
              as-is.
            </p>
            <p>
              Often, however, the two schemas are not identical: either the
              source includes columns that are not required or that are named
              differently in the target sheet. In that case the automation will
              need to be told how to map each column of the source file to the
              target file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Typically, I'll have an <strong>Admin</strong> sheet inside the
              <strong>Admin</strong> folder. The sheet will have a tab with two
              columns: one would list the header names in the source file, and
              other will list the corresponding header in the target sheet.
            </p>
            <p>
              What I like about this approach is that it enables business users
              to manage the mapping on their own without relying on a developer
              to handle changes to the source or target schemas. Business users
              simply update the mapping cells and the automation will use the
              new names going forward.
            </p>

            <h2 id="file-names">How to identify input files</h2>
            <p>
              Another consideration is source file names. When the automation
              needs to pick up a single file at a time, file naming isn't
              normally an issue: The automation can be set to inspect the
              <strong>Inputs</strong> folder and pick the first file it finds
              there.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are cases, however, when the automation needs to handle
              multiple files, and each file needs to be processed differently.
              For instance, you may have two files and you want to pick columns
              A and B from file 1, and columns C and D from file 2.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this case, the automation will need to identify each file by
              name. To do so, I typically add a <strong>Settings</strong> tab in
              the <strong>Admin</strong> sheet. The first column in the sheet
              lists variable names that appear in the automation code, and the
              second column lists the values of these keys. The developer enters
              the variable names and the business users enter their values.
            </p>
            <p>
              This gives business users to flexibility to handle file name
              changes without changing the automation code.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are occasions when file names change all the time: for
              instance, when the file name includes the create date of the file.
              In that case, the <strong>Settings</strong> tab will include a
              name pattern that always stays the same, and the automation will
              look for file names that include these pattern.
            </p>

            <h2 id="trigger">When to run the automation</h2>

            <p>
              There are two main ways to run the automation: on-schedule or
              on-demand.
            </p>

            <p>
              On-schedule execution is usually suitable for instances when files
              are placed in the <strong>Inputs</strong> by some other agency:
              either by another automation that places the file at the same
              schedule, or by outside users who don't run the main automation.
              In such cases, the automation can be set to run periodically using
              a time-based trigger.
            </p>

            <p>
              On-demand execution means that the person who's in charge of the
              automation manually triggers the automation after he or she has
              placed the file in the <strong>Inputs</strong> folder. To achieve
              that, I typically like to create a custom menu in the
              <strong>Admin</strong> sheet that business users click on to start
              the automation.
            </p>

            <h2 id="log">How to monitor the automation</h2>

            <p>
              It's a best practice to keep track of the execution of the
              automation. Depending on client needs, I typically se the
              automation to move files in the <strong>Inputs</strong> folder to
              an <strong>Archive</strong> sub-folder as mentioned earlier. In
              conjunction with that, I sometimes set up a
              <strong>Log</strong> tab inside the <strong>Admin</strong> sheet,
              where every data ingestion is documented, including a link to the
              archived input file. This helps business users to keep up to date
              with what's going on and find the source file should a question or
              an issue arise.
            </p>

            <h2 id="human">How to deal with the human element</h2>

            <p>
              The most unpredictable element of any automation system is the
              group of people who will end up using it or supplying it with
              data. It's important, therefore, to design the automation in such
              a way that surprises require little to no change to the automation
              code. Here are some suggestions:
            </p>
            <p>
              First, make sure your developer plans for changes in any
              assumption he or she makes when designing the system. Of course,
              designing for maximum flexibility brings its own set of issues
              (and it makes the project more expensive), but there are typically
              logical what-if scenarios that you can be prepared for.
            </p>

            <p>
              Second, make sure that the developer makes all the necessary
              validations as soon as the execution starts running – rather then
              be surprised later in the execution where it's more difficult to
              pinpoint the source of the trouble. I like to use a messages tab
              in the <strong>Admin</strong> sheet where I can communicate
              validation failures to the business user once he or she hits the
              custom menu to run the automation.
            </p>

            <p>
              Third, as discussed before, it's important to use a
              <strong>Settings</strong> tab or a <strong>Mapping</strong> tab,
              as indicated before, where business users can change different
              attributes of the system on their own, without requiring code
              change.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, it's important to keep an open mind and understand that
              some changes cannot be anticipated and will require code change.
              When such changes are needed and they're relatively small in
              scope, I and other developers I know don't charge our clients
              extra and simply make the changes "on the house."

                  This Google Apps Script accepts a URL to a Google Drive folder
                  that contains several source files (Google Sheets, Excel, and
                  CSV). The script duplicates a sheet template, merges the
                  source files based on a common key, and then populates the
                  templated sheet. The output sheet includes a dashboard that
                  summarizes key information in the spreadsheet.

                  A sales manager manages all sales leads in a Google Sheet. She
                  needs to route leads to her team and have her reps follow up
                  on the leads and update their status and information.

                  Instead of having the reps update the master sheet, she uses
                  the Google Apps Script web app to distribute leads to reps and
                  update the master sheet based on reps' local updates.

                  In this small project, the client had a Google Sheet with two
                  tabs (summary and detail), and required a way to expand
                  summary rows based on date range in each of the rows. I
                  developed a Google Apps Script to enable the client to expand
                  the rows on demand.
