            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>
              This post details my experience in deploying Stripe payments using
              Google Apps Script (GAS) in three different projects. The Stripe
              platform is easy to use, and when it's combined with GAS,
              launching a payment system is straightforward.
            </p>

            <h3>Business requirements</h3>
            <p>
              When designing the solution, I've had the following business
              requirements:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Make it easy to sell more products in the future.</li>
              <li>Use a webhook to collect payment information from Stripe</li>
              <li>Record payments in a Google Sheet</li>
              <li>Email the customer an order confirmation message</li>
              <li>Make it easy for the customer to download the product</li>
              <li>
                Ensure that the order confirmation page works only for valid
                customers
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>High-level design</h3>
            <p>
              I'm sure there are many ways to implement Stripe payments on a
              website today, but here's what I ended up doing: A "Buy now"
              button on the website is linked to a
              <a
                href="https://stripe.com/payments/payment-links"
                target="_blank"
                >Stripe payment link</a
              >. When clicked, the Stripe checkout window opens.
            </p>
            <img
              src="../img/stripe-checkout.png"
              width="75%"
              alt="Stripe checkout page"
            />
            <p>
              The payment link is set to return to the product page in case of a
              problem, and to redirect to the order confirmation page after a
              successful transaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've configured Stripe to post the payment information to a
              webhook on my end.
            </p>
            <p>
              The webhook is a Google Apps script that is deployed as a web app.
              The app collects the post payload and saves it in a Google Sheet.
              The app then sends an email to the customer's email address with
              the order information.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Stripe redirects to the order confirmation page, it adds a
              session ID query parameter to the URL. I have client-side code
              that grabs the ID and sends it to the GAS web app. The app checks
              in the Google Sheet if this is a valid purchase ID. If so, then it
              sends the order information back to the client, which displays it
              on the page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both the email message and the order confirmation page include a
              download link to the product that the customer purchased.
            </p>
            <h3>Implementation pointers</h3>
            <p>
              There are a few things that I've learned from my three
              implementations of Stripe and Google Apps Script:
            </p>
            <p>
              Since the webhook handles both the Stripe posts and the order
              confirmation posts (I prefer not to use "doGet" here), then it's
              comfortable to split the traffic using a query parameter:
            </p>
            <pre><code>function doPost(e) {
  if (e.parameter && e.parameter.wh == 1) {
    return handleWebhook_(e);
  }
  if (e.parameter && e.parameter.c == 1) {
    return handleClient_(e);
  }
}</code></pre>
            <p>
              In order to display the product name on the page (and in the
              email), the web app needs to call Stripe and fetch the order
              details. It then concatenates that information with the order
              (summary) information it originally receives and saves it in the
              sheet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every order needs an order id. I opted to use Utilities.getUuid()
              for that.
            </p>
            <p>
              To display the correct download URL for the purchased product, the
              Google Sheet has a second tab for product information. The app
              looks up the product ID and gets the corresponding URL. The URL is
              included in the order confirmation email and page.
            </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            I wanted to protect the order confirmation that would prevent
            non-buyers from accessing the download link. To do so, when the page
            sends the Stripe session ID to the web app, the app looks up the ID
            in the orders sheet. If it doesn't find it (or if no ID is provided)
            then the app responds with 'invalid data supplied' message.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the ID does exist in the sheet then the app checks if this order
            has already been fulfilled (ie, this page was reloaded or
            revisited). If so, then the app responds with 'Order already
            fulfilled. Please check your inbox for order details and download
            link' message.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the order hasn't been already fulfilled then the app marks it as
            fulfilled in the sheet, and sends the order information back to the
            client. In my case, the app sends the entire HTML snippet to render
            on the page, as the page itself contains almost nothing except the
            Javascript code.
          </p>
          <h3>Productivity pointers</h3>
          <p>
            To speed up development, I captured the entire payload that Stripe
            sends to the webhook and saved it as a dev object in my script. I
            then created a function that calls doPost() with the object (as well
            as the routing query parameter mentioned above). That way I didn't
            have to regenerate Stripe calls to my webhook.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another time-saver was to implement a proxy webhook for the order
            confirmation page. As I was developing the web app code, I didn't
            want to waste time re-deploying the app after every code change, so
            that the order confirmation page will always use the latest version.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead, I have a general-purpose proxy server that I built using
            Google Apps Script. This web app gets a routing query parameter and
            the payload. It calls the right function based on the routing
            parameter, passing it the payload. The function then uses
            URLFetchApp() to fetch the '/dev' URL of the web app that always
            points to the head deployment. Once the web app is ready to go, I
            deploy it, and updates the Javascript on the order confirmation page
            to call the web app instead of the proxy server.
