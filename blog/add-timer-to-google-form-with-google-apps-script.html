            <p>
              Adding a timer to a form is a great way to limit the time alloted
              to fill out and submit the form. If you run online quizzes, for
              instance, a timer mapped to a form can go a long way. Google Form
              doesn't allow us to embed a timer inside a form, but luckily we
              can use Google Apps Script to build a web app that has a timer and
              embeds a form.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this tutorial we will build such a web app. In addition to the
              timer, the web app will allow the form user to pause the timer
              once, and then resume filling out the form (in case they need a
              bathroom break, for example).
            </p>
            <p>
              But wait, there's more: our web app will also collect data on how
              users interact with the form: when they access it, pause it,
              resume it, run out of time, or submit the form.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we're done, our timer-boosted Google Form web app will look
              like this:
            </p>
            <img
              class="responsive-img"
              src="../img/google-form-timer-webapp.png"
              alt="Google Form timer webapp"
            />
            <p>Sounds fun? Let's goooo!</p>
            <h2>Setup</h2>
            <p>
              To build this web app, create a brand new Google Apps Script file.
              It will house the entire code of the web app. You also want to
              create a simple Google Form with 2-3 questions. Name one of your
              questions "Your assigned ID".
            </p>

            <div class="card-panel alert-notice">
              In this tutorial, I am availing the web app to all users, even
              anonymous. Google Apps Script doesn't let you, as the script
              owner, access the anonymous user's email address. Because I want
              to be able to map the form responses to the form activities I'm
              collecting in the web app, I need to use some form of
              identification. I will use a randomly generated ID for every form.
              The script will enter the ID in the question's answer
              automatically, so that the user need not worry about that. If
              you're going to deploy the web app only for users in your Google
              Workspace account, then the ID isn't needed: you can get the
              user's email address directly.
            </div>
            <p>
              Store the form responses in a Google Sheet that you can access by
              clicking on the "Responses" tab inside the form designer, then
              click on the Google Sheet icon, and select a new Google Sheet. It
              will be stored in the same Google Drive folder of your form. Open
              the sheet and add a new tab named "Timesheet". We will log the
              webapp events in this tab, so go ahead and add three column
              headers in the first row: "UUID", "Date/Time", and "Event".
            </p>
            <h2>The main HTML</h2>

            <p>
              For our webapp to work, we need to create an HTML page that will
              include the timer and embed the Google Form. Inside your Google
              Apps Script file, create an "index.html" page and paste there the
              following markup (heads-up, it contains bare-bones styling since I
              am NOT a designer):
            </p>
            <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html>

        margin: auto;
      }
      #footer {

      &lt;div id="timer">
        &lt;p>
          Time alloted:
          &lt;span id="time-alloted">&lt;/span>
        &lt;/p>
        &lt;p>Time remaining: &lt;span id="time-remaining">&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
        &lt;button>Pause once&lt;/button>
      &lt;/div>
      &lt;iframe
        id="my-iframe"
        width="640"
        frameborder="0"

      >
    &lt;/div>
    &lt;div id="footer">&lt;div class="container">Footer&lt;/div>&lt;/div>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</code></pre>
            <p>
              Above, we define a "timer" div that includes three components:
              time alloted, time remaining, and a pause button. We also have the
              iFrame element, but we don't define the "src" attribute to the
              form, because we want to set it dynamically with code so that we
              can append the UUID to it (more on that later).
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm also including a "footer" div for demo-purposes only: we'll
              use this tutorial to see how we can change the height of the
              iFrame programmatically, and the footer will help us visualize the
              change in the iFrame height. You certainly don't need to include
              it for the form to work.
            </p>

            <h2>The error page</h2>

            <p>
              Since we will avail the form to anonymous users, we cannot get
              their email address. This means that when we provide our form
              users the URL to our webapp, we need to generate a unique UUID for
              each user and append it as a query parameter to the end of the URL
              (we will shortly run a function to do this for us). This UUID
              gives us certain interesting capabilities. For instance, we can
              block users who access the form without supplying a valid UUID. We
              can also block users who access the form for the second time after
              having visited the form before (even if they didn't submit the
              form!!!). In such a scenario, we want our web app to serve an
              error page, instead of the main HTML, notifying the user about the
              problem. So create a second page named "error.html" and paste the
              following markup:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
&lt;html lang="en">
  &lt;head>
    &lt;meta charset="UTF-8" />
    &lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
    &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    &lt;title>Error&lt;/title>
    &lt;base target="_top" />
    &lt;style>
      html,
      body {
        font-family: sans-serif, Arial;
      }
      h1 {
        text-align: center;
      }
      .container {
        width: 90%;
        margin: auto;
      }
    &lt;/style>
  &lt;/head>
  &lt;body>
    &lt;div class="container">
      &lt;h1>Error&lt;/h1>
      &lt;p style="text-align: center">&lt;?!= serverData.error ?>&lt;/p>
    &lt;/div>
  &lt;/body>
&lt;/html>
</code></pre>

            <p>
              This is super-simple page. The only notable thing here is the
              <strong>&lt;?!= serverData.error ?></strong> scriplet tag. It
              allows our Google Apps Script web app to dynamically insert the
              error message that we will generate into the page before it's
              rendered in the browser.
            </p>

            <h2>Serving the main page</h2>

            <p>
              Let's create a function that will deliver our "index.html" page to
              users of our web app. Inside the "Code.gs" page, enter the
              following code:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">function doGet(e) {
  const htmlTemplate = HtmlService.createTemplateFromFile('index');
  const htmlOutput = htmlTemplate.evaluate();
  return htmlOutput;
}</code></pre>

            <p>
              Above, we define the <strong>doGet</strong> function that creates
              a template from our index.html file and evaluate it, which
              generates the HTML code that the function finally returns to the
              client. Note that "doGet" must be called just that in order for
              Apps Script to run it automatically.
            </p>

            <p>
              While we're at it, let's create the function that will serve the
              error page:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">function sendError(message) {
  const htmlTemplate = HtmlService.createTemplateFromFile('error');
  htmlTemplate.serverData = { error: message };
  const htmlOutput = htmlTemplate.evaluate();
  return htmlOutput;
}</code></pre>

            <p>
              You can see above that we are attaching a "serverData" object to
              our template. The object contains an "error" key that has the
              message that the function receives as its value. You may recall
              that in our error.html page, we use a scriptlet tag to render this
              serverData.error in our HTML page. That's how we push data from
              the server to the page.
            </p>

            <p>
              Go ahead and deploy the script as a web app by clicking on the
              blue Deploy button. Select "Web app" from the gear icon. Make sure
              the script executes as you and is available to anyone. When you're
              done, copy the generated web app URL and store it someplace. We'll
              use it next.
            </p>

            <h2>Generating web app links</h2>

            <p>
              Just like we share a Google Form with users by copying its URL, we
              need to give the web app users its URL. But remember that we need
              to generate and append a unique ID (UUID) to each URL so that we
              know who's who. Let's create a function that we can run anytime we
              need to generate a new URL for a user:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">function genFormUrl() {
  const webappUrl = 'paste-your-webapp-url-here';
  const uuid = Utilities.getUuid();
  console.log(webappUrl + `?uuid=${uuid}`);
}</code></pre>

            <p>
              The function above will simply generate a random ID and append it
              to the uuid query parameter at the end of your web app URL. Just
              paste your webapp url inside the single quotes.
            </p>

            <h2>Recording events in our timesheet</h2>

            <p>
              Now that we have the facility to generate webapp URLs with unique
              IDs, we can report on how our webapp is used. Let's create a
              generic function that will receive a UUID and an event and log
              them into our timesheet:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">function updateServer(uuid, event) {
  const now = Utilities.formatDate(
    new Date(),
    Session.getScriptTimeZone(),
    'MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss'
  );
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.openById('paste-your-google-sheet-id-here');
  const timesheet = ss.getSheetByName('Timesheet');
  timesheet.appendRow([uuid, now, event]);
  SpreadsheetApp.flush();
}</code></pre>
            <p>
              To get the ID of your Google Sheet, simply copy the last sequence
              of characters from the end of its web address, without any forward
              slashes. Paste it in the code above. The function will generate a
              new Date object and convert it to a formatted date/time string. It
              will append a row that populates the three columns in our
              Timesheet tab.
            </p>

            <p>
              Let's record the event of creating a new link. We will use this
              log momentarily to validate users' UUIDs. Simply insert a call to
              the function into your <strong>genFromUrl</strong> function:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">function genFormUrl() {
  const webappUrl = 'paste-your-webapp-url-here';
  const uuid = Utilities.getUuid();
  updateServer(uuid, 'Created form');  // Our logging call here
  console.log(webappUrl + `?uuid=${uuid}`);
}</code></pre>

            <p>
              Let's also record the event of serving the form to a user. Update
              your <strong>doGet</strong> function accordingly:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">function doGet(e) {
  updateServer(uuid, 'Started form');  // Our logging call here
  const htmlTemplate = HtmlService.createTemplateFromFile('index');
  const htmlOutput = htmlTemplate.evaluate();
  return htmlOutput;
}</code></pre>

            <h2>Validating UUIDs</h2>

            <p>
              Now that we are logging events, we can validate the users who are
              accessing our web app, and redirect them to our error page if they
              don't meet our validation criteria. Below, we run three checks: we
              ensure that a UUID exists in the webapp url, that the UUID appears
              in our log (to ensure that the user isn't attaching a fake UUID,
              and that the user hasn't been served the webapp before):
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">function doGet(e) {
  // Check if uuid is present
  if (!e.parameter || !e.parameter.uuid) {
    return sendError(
      `UUID parameter is missing. Contact form manager for details.`
    );
  }
  // Check if uuid was previously issued
  const uuid = e.parameter.uuid;
  const ss = SpreadsheetApp.openById('paste-your-google-sheet-id-here');
  const timesheet = ss.getSheetByName('Timesheet');
  let uuids = timesheet.getRange('A2:A').getValues().flat();
  uuids = uuids.filter((u) => u === uuid);
  if (uuids.length === 0) {
    return sendError(
      `UUID "${uuid}" isn't recognized. Contact form manager for details.`
    );
  }
  // Check if form with the uuid was previously started
  if (uuids.length > 1) {
    return sendError(
      `Your UUID "${uuid}" was already used. Contact form manager for details.`
    );
  }
  updateServer(uuid, 'Started form');
  const htmlTemplate = HtmlService.createTemplateFromFile('index');
  htmlTemplate.serverData = { uuid, timeAlloted: '00:00:10' };
  const htmlOutput = htmlTemplate.evaluate();
  return htmlOutput;
}</code></pre>

            <p>
              Above, we look for the uuid query parameter. If we can't find it
              then we return our error page with the message. Next, we access
              our Timesheet tab and get all of our existing UUIDs that have been
              recorded there. We're looking for the user's UUID. If we cannot
              find it, then we send the error page for it. Lastly, we ensure
              that our list of UUIDs contains the user's UUID only once (for
              when the form was created). If it appears more than once then it
              means that the user accessed the web app before and we prevent
              them from accessing it again.
            </p>

            <p>
              At this point you can test your web app by clicking on Deploy >
              Test deployment, and accessing the test url. You should see the
              error page. Next, run <strong>genFormUrl</strong>, copy the
              ?uuid=abc123 from the log and attach it to your DEV url. The form
              should now appear.
            </p>
            <div class="card-panel alert-notice">
              Note that if you try to access the /exec URL then you will not see
              your latest code in action. For this to happen you need to click
              "Deploy" > "Edit deployments", click the pencil icon, select a new
              version, and click deploy. This will update the deployment with
              your latest code.
            </div>

            <h2>The timer, finally</h2>

            <p>
              Talk about bury the lede! But all this preparatory work is needed
              in order to take full advantage of the timer. Without it, the
              timer is probably useless: users would be able to access the form
              multiple times.
            </p>

            <p>
              The first thing we need to do is to pass the UUID from the server
              to the client, so that we can incorporate it into our form. We can
              also push the alloted time for the form. Let's change our doPost
              slightly:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">  const htmlTemplate = HtmlService.createTemplateFromFile('index');
  htmlTemplate.serverData = { uuid, timeAlloted: '00:01:00' };
  const htmlOutput = htmlTemplate.evaluate();</code></pre>

            <p>
              Above, I'm including the new line that needs to come between the
              two existing lines. We're attaching the serverData object to the
              template and initiate the time alloted to 1 minute.
            </p>

            <p>
              Go back your index.html page and add a
              <strong>&lt;script>&lt/script></strong> tag right before the
              closing <strong>&lt;/body></strong> tag. We're going to include a
              lot of client-side Javascript inside the script tag.
            </p>

            <p>
              First, we need to write the server data to the page, so that we
              can access it in code:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Set server data
const uuid = '&lt?!= serverData.uuid ?>';
const timeAlloted = '&lt;?!= serverData.timeAlloted ?>';</code></pre>

            <p>
              Google Apps Script will write the two variables into the page as
              if we manually typed them.
            </p>
            <p>Next, let's define the components that we will manipulate:</p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Declare components
const iframe = document.querySelector('#my-iframe');
const timer = document.querySelector('#timer');
const h1 = document.querySelector('h1');
const button = document.querySelector('button');
const timeRemainingSpan = document.querySelector('#time-remaining');</code></pre>

            <p>
              Now we can work on our form iFrame. Add the following code, and
              I'll explain it below:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Set the iframe
let loadCounter = 0;
let formSubmitted = false;
let formPaused = false;
iframe.onload = function () {
  loadCounter += 1;
  if (loadCounter === 1) {
    iframe.style.height = '800px';
  } else if (loadCounter === 2) {
    iframe.style.height = '300px';
    formSubmitted = true;
    timer.style.display = 'none';
    google.script.run
    .withSuccessHandler(onSuccessSubmit)
    .updateServer(uuid, 'Submitted the form');

  function onSuccessSubmit(message) {
    h1.innerText = message;
  }
  }
};</code></pre>

            <p>
              Above, we adjust the height of the iFrame whenever it loads. When
              we set its src attribute (momentarily), it loads the first time.
              When the user Submits the form, the iFrame loads the confirmation
              page (that's a second time). So we use "loadCounter" to know the
              state of the iFrame and adjust its height accordingly.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note that we are also calling out our server-side
              <strong>updateServer</strong> when the user submits the form.
              Obviously we know that they submit from the fact that Google Form
              records their submission in the Google Sheet, but I'm showcasing
              this capability here for completion-sake. Note that the time of
              the log record will be slightly behind the time that Google Form
              will report.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now we need to paste the form URL to the iFrame. But we also want
              to pre-fill the UUID into our question so that the user doesn't
              have to do that. To do so, open the Google Form, click the three
              dots on the right, click "Get pre-filled link", enter 'xxxxx' in
              the ID question value, click the purple "Get link" button, and
              then the black "Copy link" button at the bottom of the page.
            </p>

            <p>
              Now paste the URL in your code and add the delete the 'xxxxx':
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">iframe.src =
'https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/your-form-path/viewform?embedded=true&usp=pp_url&entry.your-question-number=' +
uuid;</code></pre>

            <p>
              Try reloading the page and see if the form renders. You might want
              to comment out temporarily the test of multiple UUIDs inside
              <strong>doGet</strong> so that you don't need to issue a new UUID
              any time you work on the code.
            </p>

            <p>Let's initialize the timer:</p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">// Set timer
document.querySelector('#time-alloted').innerText = timeAlloted;
const timeRemaining = new Date();
const [hoursRemaining, minutesRemaining, secondsRemaining] =
  timeAlloted.split(':');
timeRemaining.setHours(
  hoursRemaining,
  minutesRemaining,
  secondsRemaining
);</code></pre>

            <p>
              Time alloted is static, so we just enter the string from the
              server. But time remaining is dynamic â€“ we will decrement it every
              second â€“ so that we store it in a separate variable that is
              initialized with the hours, minutes, and seconds counts of time
              alloted.
            </p>

            <h2>Decrementing time remaining</h2>

            <p>
              We need a function that will reduce time remaining by one second,
              unless the time has run out, the user has paused the timer (for a
              bathroom break), or the user has submitted the form. Here's the
              code:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">function updateTimeRemaining() {
  timeRemaining.setSeconds(timeRemaining.getSeconds() - 1);
  const hh = timeRemaining.getHours();
  const mm = timeRemaining.getMinutes();
  const ss = timeRemaining.getSeconds();
  timeRemainingSpan.innerText =
    String(hh).padStart(2, '0') +
    ':' +
    String(mm).padStart(2, '0') +
    ':' +
    String(ss).padStart(2, '0');
  if (hh === 0 && mm === 0 && ss === 0) {
    iframe.style.display = 'none';
    h1.innerText = 'You ran out of time!';
    button.disabled = 'disabled';
    google.script.run.updateServer(uuid, 'Ran out of time');
    return;
  }
  if (formSubmitted || formPaused) {
    return;
  }
  setTimeout(updateTimeRemaining, 1000);
}</code></pre>

            <p>
              The function defines a timeout of one second after which the
              function wil be called again, if the conditions described above
              are not met. Note that if the time runs out, we call our
              server-side <strong>updateServer</strong> function, so that it can
              log the fact that time has elapsed.
            </p>

            <p>
              We can initiate the countdown inside the
              <strong>onload</strong> function when loadCounter is 1:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">if (loadCounter === 1) {
  iframe.style.height = '800px';
  updateTimeRemaining();
}</code></pre>

            <h2>Pause and resume</h2>

            <p>
              Finally, we can allow the user to pause and resume the form one
              time when they click on the button. Here's the code:
            </p>

            <pre><code class="language-javascript">button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  if (button.innerText === 'Pause once') {
    formPaused = true;
    iframe.style.display = 'none';
    button.innerText = 'Resume';
    google.script.run.updateServer(uuid, 'Paused the form');
  } else {
    formPaused = false;
    iframe.style.display = 'block';
    button.innerText = 'Pause used';
    button.disabled = 'disabled';
    google.script.run.updateServer(uuid, 'Resumed the form');
    updateTimeRemaining();
  }
});</code></pre>

            <p>
              Above, we add a click event listener to the button. We check its
              state: if it shows the default "Pause once" caption then we set
              formPaused to true, which will cause our
              <strong>updateTimeRemaining</strong> to pause the timer. The form
              disappears so that the user cannot continue to work on it.
              Clicking the button again brings back the form, sets "formPaused"
              to false, restarts <strong>updateTimeRemaining</strong> and
              disables the button. Note that we report on form pause and form
              resume events.
            </p>

            <p>
              This is it. If you made it thus far then I'm really proud of you!
              It's a lot to take in, but I hope you can see the power of this
              approach. Now you can run analysis in Google Sheet, comparing the
              form results to the activities you logged, and seeing which UUIDs
              access the form but don't submit it.
            </p>
            <p>Happy form-timing!</p>
