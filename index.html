              The project involved pulling information about YouTube channels
              and their videos and playlists, using the YouTube Data API. A
              Google Apps Script was built to take an arbitrary number of
              channel IDs, get their metadata, and then iterate through their
              videos and playlists and get their own metadata.

              This project involves parsing addresses in a Google Sheet along
              with their metadata. A Google Apps Script is launched via a custom
              menu. It creates a sidebar with a Google Map, converts the
              addresses into lat/long data points, centers the map according to
              the addresses, and displays the addresses as markers on the map.
            </p>
            <p>
              Address metadata is shown when the user hovers over the marker.
              The map can be viewed in full-screen mode.
